Finished the first version of the game as presented in Python Crash Course. Will implement some of the ideas below later to make
the game more personalized and unique.

### Game Interface Improvements
- [ ] Have user enter username and assosiate a high score with that user
- [ ] Input a table of the top 10 highscores at the end of the game
- [ ] Keep track of the all time high scores

### Alien Mods
- [ ] Have different difficulty aliens which require more that 1 shot to destroy
- [ ] Have a big alien "boss" near the end
- [ ] Have aliens drop bombs or fire shots back

### Ship powerups
- [ ] Have a laser cannon that pierces all ship in the line of sight
- [ ] Add homing missiles
